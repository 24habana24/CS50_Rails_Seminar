##About
This repository contains a basic rails app in 4 different stages of development
with comments on the changes that took place between each version. The goal is
to demonstrate how MVC works in rails and how resources can be created, 
updated, and destroyed (CRUD) with a simple todo list app.

Thanks to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html, and for further
instruction, please visit the ruby on rails documentation (including the URL
listed above).

##Included
1. Todo List Starting Out (setting up the framework)
2. Todo List With Items (generatign resources)
3. Todo List With MVC (integrate the database)
4. Todo List Final (full CRUD-able actions)
