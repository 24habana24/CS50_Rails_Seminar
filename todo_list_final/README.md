##A Working Example With Rails
######Thanks to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
Look through and see a working app that can create, edit, update, and destroy (CRUD) items in a todo list

*Changes from prior steps:*
####Step 1: edit
  *Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb
  *Creates and edits app/views/items/edit.html.erb
  *Edits app/views/items/index.html.erb

####Step 2: destroy
  *Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb
  *Edits app/views/items/index.html.erb
