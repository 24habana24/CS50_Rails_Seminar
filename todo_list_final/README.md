##A Working Example With Rails (Part 4 of 4)
######Thanks to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

####Goals
Look through and see a working app that can create, edit, update, and destroy 
(CRUD) items in a todo list

####NOTE: in order to run the final version without completing prior steps:

(i.e. if you have simply git cloned this repository into your computer rather 
than following along the tutorial step by step in a project you created)

$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate

*Changes from prior steps:*
####Step 1: edit
  *Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb
  *Edits to app/views/items/edit.html.erb (creates this file as well)
  *Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb

####Step 2: destroy
  *Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb
  *Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb
